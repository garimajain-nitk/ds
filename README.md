# Projects specific to Data Science 

**patient_age_los_analysis.ipynb** - Performs comprehensive data analysis on kaggle healthcare insurance dataset. It uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore the correlation between age groups and length of stay, examining whether older patients are more likely to experience extended hospital stays.

**drift_analysis.ipynb** - Calculates PSI (population stability index) to measure how much patient age’s distribution has shifted between two samples.

**EDA_los_paidamt** - Gains insights into the relationships between paidamt and length of stay. This analysis helped in making informed decisions on the direction of the constraints for each feature.

**biobert_embeddings_cosine_similarity** - Compares two vectors using cosine similarity. Utilizes BioBERT model to generate embeddings for diagnosis codes.

**fairness_analysis** - Conducted a thorough bias assessment using the Precision metric, applying bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals and Cohen’s d to compare global and subgroup Precision distributions.

**sklearnPCA_vs_explicit_calculation** - This notebook compares the outcome of sklearn PCA algorithm with manual, step by step dimensionality reduction for iris dataset. Leverages the concepts of covariance of a matrix, eigen values, eigen vectors, linear transformations and vector projections.
