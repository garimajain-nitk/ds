**patient_age_los_analysis.ipynb** - Performs comprehensive data analysis on kaggle healthcare insurance dataset. It uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore the correlation between age groups and length of stay, examining whether older patients are more likely to experience extended hospital stays.

**drift_analysis.ipynb** - Calculates PSI (population stability index) to measure how much patient age’s distribution has shifted between two samples.
