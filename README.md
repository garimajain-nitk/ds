# Projects specific to Data Science 

**patient_age_los_analysis.ipynb** - Performs comprehensive data analysis on kaggle healthcare insurance dataset. It uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore the correlation between age groups and length of stay, examining whether older patients are more likely to experience extended hospital stays.

**drift_analysis.ipynb** - Calculates PSI (population stability index) to measure how much patient age’s distribution has shifted between two samples.

**EDA_los_paidamt** - To gain insights into the relationships between paidamt and length of stay. This analysis helped in making informed decisions on the direction of the constraints for each feature.
